    "comment": "So I had a couple friends complain about Strange giving up the stone, and I've seen a few of those complaints on here and other forums. \n\nI feel like it's obvious he gave up the Time stone because he saw that is the one way they beat Thanos. I don't know if he specifically saw himself giving up the stone, or he saw Tony do something to save the day, but Strange gave up the stone to help his vision of the \"one way it works\" come to pass. \n\nIt's written all over that last interaction with Thanos and Strange and then Strange and Stark. Thanos chastizes Strange for never using the Time stone, but we clearly did see him use it. The power of the Time stone won't help in a brute-force battle, but it can help reveal the one unlikely path to victory. \n\nThen, as Strange disappears, he pointedly tells Stark that this was the only way. That there was no other way. I don't remember his exact phrase, but it really felt to me that Strange was trying to tell Stark that this is *still* part of the one way they beat Thanos. \n\nSo it isn't that Strange had a change of character, growing weak and sacrificing the universe to save a new friend. He was making the strategic play, giving up the Time stone because it plays a part in the only part to victory that he saw. \n\nJust wanted to put that out there."

It's the Empire Strikes Back of superhero movies, only even less hopeful.  \nAlso, this is, for me anyway, the first time we see some _real_ **super**powers. Be it Strange's amazing magic, powered up Thor, Iron-SwissArmyKnife-Man or the multiple different powers of the infinity stones.\n\n\nAlso, Starlord is a fuckwad."
